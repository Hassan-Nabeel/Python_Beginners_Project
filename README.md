# Python_Beginners_Project
The README file contains description of the following projects:
<br>
1. Number Guessing Game:
<br>
•	Developed a Number Guessing Game between the intervals given by the user.
<br>
•	Module used: random
<br>
• Program runs on an infinite while loop until the user guesses the random number also printing its number of attempts.
<br>
<br>
3. Quiz Game:
<br>
•	Developed a Quiz Game in which the program asks predefined questions to the user.
<br>
•	The program uses the if-else statements block and as a result returns how many correct answers would the user give.
<br>
<br>
4. Password Generator:
<br>
•	Developed a program for the generation of passwords that takes input as the length of a password.
<br>
•	Module used: random
• Define a function with a for loop that generates a random password using defined character values. 
<br>
<br>
6. Rock Paper Scissors:
<br>
•	Developed a game that is played between the user and the system.
<br>
•	Module used: random,
• Declared rock, paper, scissors in a variable and generate random values in correspondence to the variable.
<br>
•	The program uses an infinite while loop with an if-else statement block until one of them becomes the winner or the match is drawn.
<br>
<br>
8. Mad Libs Generator:
<br>
•	Developed a Mad Libs generator where one player prompts another for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story.
<br>
•	We read a story from a text file and for the blank/mentioned places, we assigned/replaced values using a dictionary that operates on a for loop.
<br>
<br>
9. Tic Tac Toe:
<br>
•	Developed a game Tic Tac Toe which takes input from users as numeric positions.
<br>
•	Defined three functions within a game i.e., for the development of the board, for performing sum, and to check the winner.
<br>
•	Store the list of zeros in the variable, define the user turn, and run an infinite while loop. Initiate the loop by calling the board function followed by user input and then calling the check function with the sum function.
<br>
•	At last, the winner is announced if any of the users wins or else the program print match is drawn.
